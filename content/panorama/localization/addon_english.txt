	"overthrow_game_info_tip05"						"• If the <font color='#0BE000'>income</font> or <font color='#0BE000'>creep</font> bar is getting in the way, you can press the <font color='#0BE000'>collapse button</font> on each to hide or move it."
	"overthrow_game_info_tip06"						"• Moving your controller (the wizard courier) to the stone on your team's island gives your courier <font color='#34C9FA'>mana</font> at the cost of <font color='#FFCC00'>gold</font>."
